# Protein Structure Prediction Using Threading

This project focuses on protein structure prediction using the threading (fold recognition) method. Threading is a computational approach that aligns a target protein sequence with known structures to predict its 3D structure, even when sequence similarity is low. This method identifies candidate templates by considering both sequence and structural similarities, such as predicted secondary structures and solvent accessibility. By mapping the target sequence onto structurally similar templates, threading can accurately predict protein folds, making it a valuable tool in bioinformatics, medicine, and biotechnology.
